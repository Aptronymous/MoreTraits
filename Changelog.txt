Changelog Notes:
Fixed bug that would give the player negative XP if they use a hobby trait
Super Immune takes being well fed into account, and now speeds up recovery phase for each minute the player was well fed.
Motion Sickness and Super Immune traits are now exclusive with each other, as they both use the same value.
Motion Sickness now damages you while driving, relative to sickness level.
