description=[h1]A Personal Appeal To Decency: [/h1]
description=Please do not add me directly on Steam or comment on my profile for help with this mod. Use the discord for that.
description=
description=[h1]Information: [/h1]
description=This mod adds a great deal more variety to the traits available to players during character creation.
description=
description=The most prominent feature so far is the introduction of 1-point-cost traits which give players a minor boon.
description=so far, this includes a series of Prepared traits, which allow users to spend their trait points to give them certain starting items.
description=
description=The mod also attempts to add a greater variety of expense, as in there are more -1, -2, -3, -5 traits. This should help prevent the annoying feeling of having one solitary point left with nothing to spend it on.
description=
description=Dynamic Traits submod has been added - you can earn/loose traits by leveling skills, list of all available perks can be found [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YM0g4fTXrDiDYuvFvNkmqEjFIaTIK4_Bb0dQvmLnIvA/edit?usp=sharing]here[/url]. Out of 91 or so available perks, 42 can be made dynamic
