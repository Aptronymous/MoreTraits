Changelog Notes:
Action Hero wasn't halving damage.
Action Hero has increased multiplier so fighting hordes is more rewarding.
Hardy wasn't accounting for Sprinting.
Typo in Martial Artist
General code optimization pass.
Added a to-do list to keep track of ongoing issues that need addressing.
Fixed Bouncer not giving Short Blunt.
Added an Authors text file to the directory. This will be where anyone wishing to receive credit for working on the
mod may place their name. I'll include the authors on the Steam Workshop page.
Removed the lump of textual options for players to say when performing cannibalism. It was just too corny and would be
a pain to move over to UI_EN.
Migrated text from code to UI_EN for translation.
Added Translation: Simplified Chinese. Credit to: EndsM for work!
Fix issue with player weight being higher than default.
Adjusted values of Packmule and Packmouse.
Increased Cost of Gordanite from 5 to 6, as the new improved function makes it much more powerful.
Increased Cost of Martial Artist from 4 to 5 to balance its strength versus its cost.
Made Blissful and Smoker mutually exclusive, as it was negating the effects of Smoker.
Butterfingers chance to drop was too low and almost never procced. It's still rare, but now has a higher chance.
Adjusted Butterfingers drop chance roll to run every minute instead of every ten minutes. (only procs if you're moving, so it wasn't consistent every ten minutes)
Tweaked randomized damage and healing values for Broke Leg and Injured traits, as the wounds were healing within one day, and should require a little more nursing to be worth the cost.
Added Sandbox Options. Credit to: SteadySpring
Migrated Trait Initialization to Shared folder so Servers can "see" traits.
Added better server compatibility.
No more "Unknown Trait" messages.
Administrators should be able to add/remove traits without them disappearing altogether.
