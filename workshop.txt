description=[h1]IMPORTANT: Build 41.68 and Higher [/h1]
description=Due to false-flags for anti-cheat, it is recommended to disable anti-cheat when hosting a server with this mod. You can try enabling some anti-cheats, but your mileage may vary.

description=[h1]A Personal Appeal To Decency: [/h1]
description=Please do not add me directly on Steam or comment on my profile for help with this mod. Use the discord for that.
description=
description=[h1]Information: [/h1]
description=This mod adds a great deal more variety to the traits available to players during character creation.
description=
description=This includes, but not limited to: traits that add some starting equipment, traits that increase your starting level in specific skills but don't give exp multiplier, a bunch of unique traits with interesting effects (examples: better weapons proficiencies, better exp gains for specific playstyle, zombie infection immunity with cure period, scavenging perks, driving perks, and so on). Of course, your typical +1/2 in some skills perks are also present.
description=
description=The mod also attempts to add a greater variety of expense, as in there are more -1, -2, -3, -5 traits. This should help prevent the annoying feeling of having one solitary point left with nothing to spend it on.
description=
description=Dynamic Traits submod has been added - you can earn/lose traits by leveling skills, list of all available perks can be found [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YM0g4fTXrDiDYuvFvNkmqEjFIaTIK4_Bb0dQvmLnIvA/edit?usp=sharing]here[/url]. Out of 91 or so available perks, 42 can be made dynamic. Some additional info can be found [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1299328280/3551679689856511505/]here[/url]

description=[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*] Made of Glass trait sometimes hurts players while sleeping. (Haven't experienced this in a while. Might be fixed?)
description=[*] Killing players in Multiplayer with Martial Artist does not sync their death to the server.
description=[*] (MP only) Most of the times, items duplicated/created with Scrounger (or any other mod/perk that creates/duplicates loot) disappear after being picked up from container. This is connected with the way loot is generated in MP. To bypass this, you have to drop items generated by these perks from container on the ground first. IF anyone has solution or seen mod that works in MP, please let us know.
