[h1]IMPORTANT: Build 41.68 and Higher [/h1]
Due to false-flags for anti-cheat, it is recommended to disable anti-cheat when hosting a server with this mod. You can try enabling some anti-cheats, but your mileage may vary.


[h1]A Personal Appeal To Decency: [/h1]
Please do not add me directly on Steam or comment on my profile for help with this mod. Use the discord for that.

[h1]Information: [/h1]
This mod adds a great deal more variety to the traits available to players during character creation.

This includes, but not limited to: traits that add some starting equipment, traits that increase your starting level in specific skills but don't give exp multiplier, a bunch of unique traits with interesting effects (examples: better weapons proficiencies, better exp gains for specific playstyle, zombie infection immunity with cure period, scavenging perks, driving perks, and so on). Of course, your typical +1/2 in some skills perks are also present.

The mod also attempts to add a greater variety of expense, as in there are more -1, -2, -3, -5 traits. This should help prevent the annoying feeling of having one solitary point left with nothing to spend it on.

Dynamic Traits submod is present - you can earn/lose traits by leveling skills, list of all available perks can be found [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YM0g4fTXrDiDYuvFvNkmqEjFIaTIK4_Bb0dQvmLnIvA/edit?usp=sharing]here[/url]. Note, that almost everything is configurable through sandbox settings (120 Sandbox options). Want to make only specific perks dynamic? I got you covered,choose which perks you want 1by1. Want to change Skill level requirement to make it easier or harder? No problem, do that. Out of 90+ or so available perks, 50+ can be made dynamic.

[h1]Opening The Project Up To The Community: [/h1]
The Mod is now available on GitHub for others to contribute.

https://github.com/hypnotoadtrance/MoreTraits

Here you will find the bleeding-edge version of the mod as I and the community continue to build upon it.

Regular updates will be posted to the Steam Workshop when appropriate.

[h1]Public Discord: [/h1]
Because Steam comment sections aren't the best space for collaboration, I've set up a Discord server for this mod.

Since the project is officially moving to Github and opening up, it stands to reason that anyone working together on the project will want a place to work together.

https://discord.gg/6Czm3uqn4z

There, you will be able to share servers, discuss suggestions, make bug reports, perform translations, and get help coding for the project.
