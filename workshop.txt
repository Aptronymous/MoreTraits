description=[h1]A Personal Appeal To Decency: [/h1]
description=Please do not add me directly on Steam or comment on my profile for help with this mod. Use the comments/discussions/discord for that.

description=[h1]Information: [/h1]
description=This mod adds a great deal more variety to the traits available to players during character creation.
description=
description=The most prominent feature so far is the introduction of 1-point-cost traits which give players a minor boon.
description=so far, this includes a series of Prepared traits, which allow users to spend their trait points to give them certain starting items.
description=
description=The mod also attempts to add a greater variety of expense, as in there are more -1, -2, -3, -5 traits. This should help prevent the annoying feeling of having one solitary point left with nothing to spend it on.
description=
description=[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*] Evasive trait sometimes dodges when bandaging/unbandaging wounds.
description=[*] Bouncer trait knocks prone zombies back up.
description=[*] Stat Synchronization is bugged in multiplayer, meaning Hardy, Blissful, and other traits don't seem to work as intended.
